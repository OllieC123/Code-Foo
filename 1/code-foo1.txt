1. How many ping pong balls would it take to fill an
 average-sized school bus? Describe each step in your 
 thought process.

 This question is not possible to answer, mostly because there are too many
 variables and missing pieces of information. 
 Instead of giving an arbitrary numeric value, I have outlined a series of
 steps that I would use in order to find a very good approximation of the
 actual value.

 1) We have to define 'average-sized school bus'.
   Type C ('conventional') school buses are the most common large school bus.

   We determine the 'average' in a statistical sense; that is, we take all
   Type C buses currently in use and determine the average interior volume.

   We create a list: all Type C bus manufacturers 
   (since 1990; for simplicity's sake, assume buses have around a 20 year life span),
   the Type C bus models of those manufacturers,
   the interior length and width of each model (both in meters),
   the height from the floor to the ceiling of each model (meters),
       --The interior volume of buses are irregular but to find this value is
       too difficult and time-consuming to determine for each model; therefore
       we think of the bus as a cubic rectangle and use the interior cubic
       dimensions as a simpler alternative.
   total number of passenger seats in each model (assume
   bus seats are uniform in size for all models),
   and how many of each model were sold in the USA (from 1990-present).

   With this list, we can determine the 'average' length, width, height, and
   interior volume of a Type C school bus.

   avglength = SUM(length*totalSold)
       /SUM(totalSold)

   avgwidth = SUM(width*totalSold)
       /SUM(totalSold)

   avgheight = SUM(height*totalSold)
       /SUM(totalSold)

   avgvolume = SUM(length*width*height*totalSold)/SUM(totalSold)

   avgadjvolume = SUM((length*width*height-seats*SEATVOLUME)*totalSold)
       /SUM(totalSold)-DRIVERSEAT-COCKPIT+STEPS

       -- avgadjvolume is the average volume adjusted for additional
       features in the bus geometry; 

   * SUM is the sum of all values in the column

   * SEATVOLUME is a measure of the volume of a passenger seat.
   * DRIVERSEAT is a measure of the volume of a driver seat.
   * COCKPIT is a measure of the volume of the dashboard, steering wheel,
       pedals, gear shifters, etc...
   * STEPS is a measure of the volume of the space between the steps and the
       floor.
       ** The above values are all found from a single sample of a Type C bus.
       ** They are treated as constant.





 2) Next we define 'ping-pong ball'.
   Although not explicitly stated, let us assume that the ping pong ball is
   inflated, and is the standard 40mm in diameter, or .04m. 





 3) Assume ping pong balls are packed as densely as possible, since we are to
   'fill' the school bus.

   Here we choose to pack the bus using a hexagonal-close packed scheme.
   We picture the bus as a rectangular prism with no additional geometry, 
   such as seats.

   Ball packing algorithm based on hexagonal-close packed spheres:
       (A graphical representation can be found here:
           http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-packing_of_equal_spheres)

   1. Determine how many balls can fit lengthwise from one corner to the
       corner across.


       ballLowerRow1 = avglength/.04 (rounded down to nearest int)



   2. Determine how many balls can fit lengthwise on the adjacent row.

       ballLowerRow2 = (avglength-(.04/2))/.04 (rounded down to nearest int)

           --We subtract (.04/2) because the adjacent row begins from the
           center of the first ball in the first row; in other words,
           we must subtract the radius of a ball from the length of the bus.
       
   3. Determine how many rows can fit by width.
       
       ballLowerNumRow = (avgwidth-.02)/(sqrt(3)*.02)+1 (rounded down to nearest int)

           --sqrt(3)*.02 is the horizontal (bus-widthwise) distance from the center of row 1 to the
           center of row 2.

   4. Determine the total number of balls that can fit on the floor.

           (if ballLowerNumRow is even) = (ballLowerNumRow/2)*
                /                          (ballLowerRow1+ballLowerRow2)
               /
       ballLower        
               \
                \
           (else) = ((ballLowerNumRow-1)/2)*(ballLowerRow1+
                       ballLowerRow2)+ballLowerRow1

   5. Repeat 1-4 for the layer above the floor.
       The 2 ball lengths determined for the floor will be the
       same for the above layer; however, the order will be switched.

       ballUpperRow1 = ballLowerRow2,
       ballUpperRow2 = ballLowerRow1

       The rows are calculated slightly differently.
       ballUpperNumRow = (avgwidth-(.02/sqrt(3))-.02)/(sqrt(3)*.02)+1
                               (rounded down to nearest integer)

           --.02/sqrt(3) is the horizontal (bus-widthwise) distance from the center of lower row 1 to
           the center of upper row 1.

       Total number of balls that can fit on the upper layer:


           (if ballUpperNumRow is even) = (ballUpperNumRow/2)*
                /                          (ballUpperRow1+ballUpperRow2)
               /
       ballUpper        
               \
                \
           (else) = ((ballUpperNumRow-1)/2)*(ballUpperRow1+
                       ballUpperRow2)+ballUpperRow1

   6. Determine how many layers there are:

       ballLayer = (avgheight-(.02)/(.04*sqrt(6)/3)+1 (rounded down to nearest integer)

	--Height of regular tetrahedron with edge length .04 = .04*sqrt(6)/3
	--This is the vertical distance from the center of lower row 1 to the center of upper row 1.


   7. Calculate total balls that can fit.

           (if ballLayer is even) = (ballLayer/2)*
                /                          (ballUpper+ballLower)
               /
       ballTotal        
               \
                \
           (else) = ((ballLayer-1)/2)*(ballUpperRow1+
                       ballUpperRow2)+ballLower





 4) We take the ballTotal value and adjust it to the proportions of
   avgvolume/avgadjvolume (these were calculated in part (1)).

   In other words we want to find adjustedBallTotal, where:

       ballTotal/adjBallTotal = avgvolume/avgadjvolume

   SO...

   adjustedBallTotal = ballTotal*(avgadjvolume/avgvolume)

 This should give us our final (approximated) answer!
